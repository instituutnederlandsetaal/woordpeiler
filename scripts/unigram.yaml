# Number of docs to process in parallel per run. After each run,
# we check if we need to write to chunk file.
# Larger values allow more parallellism but risk overshooting the
# chunk file size target.
# Default: 100_000
docsToProcessInParallel: 10_000

# How large to grow the grouping until we write the intermediate result to disk.
# Higher values decrease processing overhead but increase memory requirements.
# Default: 5_000_000
groupsPerChunk: 5_000_000
